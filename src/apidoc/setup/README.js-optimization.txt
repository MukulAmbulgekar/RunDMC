From within /apidoc/setup, we're reusing the same JavaScript
optimization code in /setup, via simple wrappers (optimize-js.sh
and optimize-js-requests.xsl) around the original scripts. See
/setup/README.txt for more info.

Follow the same instructions here as you would there, i.e.
run optimize-js.sh from within this directory (/apidoc/setup).
