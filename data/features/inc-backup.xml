<h1>Incremental Backup</h1>

<p>Incremental Backup builds on and enhances the current backup capability by saving only the changes since the previous incremental or full backup.</p>

<p>Incremental backups consume less storage and can be completed more quickly than full backups. A smaller backup window can also enable more frequent backups.</p>

<p>Log Archiving, an existing feature, works in conjunction with backups to enable fine-grained point-in-time recovery. However, archives of logs take up quite a bit of storage. Now, with incremental backup, logs can automatically be purged in conjunction with incremental backups allowing for point-in-time recovery at a much lower cost. For example, when using daily incremental backups in conjunction with 24-hour log archive retention, a restore can be made to any point in the previous 24 hours.</p>
