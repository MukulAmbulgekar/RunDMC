<h1>Bitemporal</h1>

<p>Bitemporal Data Management handles historical data along two different timelines, making it possible to rewind the information "as it actually was" in combination with "as it was recorded" at some point in time. It facilitates the creation of complete audit trail of data.</p>
<ul><li><strong>temporal </strong>- commonly used for handling data involving time "as it was recorded"
    <ul><li>Where did John Thomas live on August 20th?</li><li>Where was the Blue Van on October 12th?</li></ul>
  </li></ul>
