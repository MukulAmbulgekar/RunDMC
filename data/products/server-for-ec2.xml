    <p>
We are pleased to announce the availability of a MarkLogic Server Standard Edition AMI (Amazon Machine Image) on the EC2 platform. This AMI is available as an hourly pay-per-use product, and can be used for anything from prototyping to test and development to full production applications. MarkLogic Server Standard Edition is limited to 40GB database size and is restricted to a single node (no multi-node clusters). There is no limit to the number of instances you can create from this AMI and of course you can instantiate and terminate them at any time. 
    </p>
    <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
    <p>
The following link, which includes pricing information, is provided for purchasing a subscription to the MarkLogic Server Standard Edition AMI service:

    <p><a href="https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/user/subscription/index.html?offeringCode=86D30D60">MarkLogic Server Standard Edition for EC2</a></p>
    <p> To purchase, you must have an account with Amazon and you must have signed up for the EC2 service. Once you subscribe, you can access the AMI by searching for "marklogic" in the "Public AMIs" portion of the EC2 management console provided by Amazon.
    </p>
    <p>
</p><h3>Community License</h3>
    <b>
The Community License is available for personal non-commercial projects, and is provided free of charge.  <b><i>Amazon will, however, charge you fees for the ec2 instance rental</i></b>. It does not restrict you to a fixed trial period, but is limited to 10GB of content. Use of MarkLogic Server under the Community License is restricted to two instances per organization. 
    </b>
    
    <p>
For your convenience, MarkLogic has made an AMI publicly available with MarkLogic Server pre-installed to make it easier to get a Community Licensed instance up and running. You can search for "marklogic" under "Public Images" from within the EC2 management console. The manifest string includes the term: "Community".
</p><p>
The instructions in the MarkLogic Server for EC2 Guide apply to launching this AMI as well, only you will be prompted for a license key rather than being presented with an end user license agreement immediately. On the page where you are prompted for a key, you can simply click on the "free" button to obtain your Community License key.
