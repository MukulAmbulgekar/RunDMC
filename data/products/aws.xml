  <h1>MarkLogic and Amazon Web Services</h1>

  <p>
    To help you get going in the cloud quickly, MarkLogic provides
    <img style="float:right" width="200" height="86" alt="Amazon Partner" src="/media/amazon/APN_Advanced-Technology-Partner-200.png"/>
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amis">Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</a>
    and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Cloud Formation templates</a>.
    The templates, which build on the AMIs, can be used to construct MarkLogic <a href="#clusters">Managed Clusters</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>MarkLogic AMIs</h3>
  <p>
      MarkLogic provides two AMI series, <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00U36DS6Y">Developer</a></strong> and
      <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00U36DTL8">Essential Enterprise</a></strong>.
  </p>

  <a name="developer"></a>
  <p>
    The free <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00U36DS6Y">Developer
    AMI</a> is suited for a variety of purposes, from development to
    proof-of-concept work. You can also bring your own license (BYOL) to this
    AMI (and use it for those purposes allowed by the terms of your license).
    After you start up this AMI, you must request and install a
    <a href="/free-developer">free developer license key</a>
    <strong>OR</strong> <a href="//docs.marklogic.com/guide/installation/procedures#id_18057">install</a>
    your own pre-paid license key.
  </p>

  <a name="ee"></a>
  <p>
    Available for purchase hourly, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00U36DTL8">
    Essential Enterprise AMI</a> comes with a pre-packaged MarkLogic
    <a href="//www.marklogic.com/pricing">Essential Enterprise</a> license key
    and the following features:
    <ul>
      <li>Search</li>
      <li>HA/DR/Replication</li>
      <li>Government-grade Security</li>
      <li>Alerting</li>
      <li>Location Services</li>
      <li>Semantics (Limited-time, promotional offer)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    If you prefer, you can also build your own custom AMIs using
    <a href="/downloads">MarkLogic installers</a>.<a href="#caveat">*</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>Launching an AMI with EC2 Console</h4>
  <p>To gain the benefits of high-availability and scalability, the best
    practice is to run MarkLogic as a cluster. The MarkLogic Cloud Formation
    templates provide the easiest way to make use of MarkLogic
    <a href="#clusters">Managed Clusters</a>, described below.</p>
  <p> If you prefer to launch an AMI directly, here are the steps (these are
    covered in the <a href="#ec2">short video below</a>):</p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create yourself an Amazon account and sign up for
        <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html">Amazon Web Services</a>.
        (You may need to provide personal details, verification, credit card
        information and the like).
      </li>
      <li>
        Browse to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace">AWS Marketplace</a>,
        search for <i>marklogic</i>, choose an AMI (or choose one of the
        Marketplace links from this page), select a region, and accept the
        terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Launch the AMI with the EC2 Console:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Choose a supported instance type (<strong>NB</strong>: MarkLogic
            AMIs will not run on micro instances).
          </li>
          <li>
            Add EBS storage. Specifically, assign an EBS volume to
            <code>/dev/sdf</code> and leave off the <i>Delete-on-termination</i>
            checkbox, to enable you to keep your data. (If you prefer, you can
            launch the AMI and subsequently attach an existing EBS volume to
            <code>/dev/sdf</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a Security Group that will open ports 7997-8100. (If you don't
            have such a group, you can create one directly in the EC2 Console
            UI).
          </li>
          <li>Proceed to start your instance.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        When your instance is started, browse to your host's port 8001, skip
        over the offer to join a cluster (unless you want to), create the
        default admin user, and continue on.  When this is completed, log back
        in via the admin user. You can then browse to port 8000 to gain access
        to the MarkLogic home page and developer tools.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>Cloud Formation Templates and MarkLogic <i>Managed Clusters</i></h3>

  <p>To gain the benefits of high-availability and scalability, the best
    practice is to run MarkLogic as a cluster. The MarkLogic Cloud Formation
    templates provide the easiest way to make use of MarkLogic <i>Managed
    Clusters</i>, the benefits of which include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Automatic handling of changes in EC2 instance hostnames.</li>
    <li>Automatic placement and management of data, to insure that nothing is lost on transient volumes.</li>
    <li>Configuration of best-practice security, load balancing, routing, and handling of volatile instances.</li>
    <li>Automatic restarting and reconfiguring of failed or unhealthy nodes in a cluster.</li>
    <li>Pausing of entire clusters, while maintaining <i>all</i> configuration and data.</li>
    <li>Simplified re-configuration of cluster instance types and topologies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you choose to launch the MarkLogic AMIs outside of the Cloud Formation
    templates, you will not have <i>automatic</i> access to the Managed Cluster
    features. (You can still gain access to those features via your own custom
    configuration and automation and the documented series of
    <a href="//docs.marklogic.com/guide/ec2/GettingStarted#id_63042">environment variables</a>
    and the <a href="//docs.marklogic.com/guide/ec2/managing#id_77550">mlcmd
    utility</a>.) For these reasons, we highly recommend starting with the
    Cloud Formation templates, even if you plan to start with a single-node
    cluster.
  </p>

  <p>
    The templates serve both as <i>Getting Started</i> points as well as
    examples. Once you are comfortable with them, we encourage and expect you
    to copy and modify them to suit your specific needs.
  </p>

  <div class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Successful launching of EC2
    instances via a Cloud Formation template requires acceptance of the License
    Agreement for the underlying AMI. Please visit the corresponding AWS
    Marketplace AMI page to accept the License Agreement <strong>before</strong>
    attempting to launch a stack from any of the templates. For details see the
    Getting Started video below. Also, if you plan to launch one of the larger
    instance types (hi1.4xlarge, cc1.4xlarge, cc2.8xlarge, cr1.8xlarge) with the
    Developer AMI, please accept terms on the
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00U36DS6Y">HVM</a> page.
    The Essential Enterprise AMI (and Cloud Formation template) can not be
    launched on these instance types.
