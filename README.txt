NOTES
  This application makes heavy use of MarkLogic XSLT to transform content stored in the database into templatized
  web pages.  There is plenty of sample code, but it is not designed, currently, for easy learning purposes.

SETUP NOTES

  The application assumes a single MarkLogic Database, with 3 app servers (Public/Main, API, Draft), a WebDAV server,
  and an XDBC server.
  
  The default ports for each environment (product, staging, development) are listed in the /config/server-urls.xml
  file.  If you desire to remove the port #s from the URLs for docs and developer, you can front the entire
  application with a web server that will proxy and rewrite URLs (Like apache or nginx).
  
  
  Main server (like developer.marklogic.com):
    App server root should be set to the root of this distribution, on 
    the filesystem.  The URL rewriter should be set to "/controller/url_rewrite.xqy".
    The error handler should be set to "/controller/error-handler.xqy".

  API/Docs server (i.e. documentation host - like docs.marklogic.com)
    App server root same as Main server.
    URL rewriter /apidoc/controller/url_rewrite.xqy
    Error handler /controller/error-handler.xqy

    See also apidoc/README.txt
   
  Draft server:
    This app server must have the word "Draft" in its name.

    On another port, same exact configuration as main server but
    with a different server name. "Draft" documents will be visible
    on this server. For "preview" to work in the Admin UI, update
    /config/server-urls.xml with the correct host name and corresponding
    draft server URL.  Default is same hostname, port 8004.

  Admin interface (CMS) server:
    This app server must have the word "Admin" in its name.

    For the Admin interface, set up a different HTTP app server,
    using the same content database and same server root. But set
    the URL rewriter to "/admin/controller/url_rewrite.xqy".
    

  WebDAV server:
    If you want "view XML source" to work in the admin UI, set up
    a WebDAV server with root set to "/". Then add the server URL to
    /config/server-urls.xml.  Default is same hostname, port 8005.

    Note: OS X users, you will want to keep OS X from creating .DS_Store files
    by doing the following

        % defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true


  XDBC server:
    If you want to use the loading tools to copy a database from 
    the live developer site, you'll need an XDBC server.
    

DEFAULT DATABASE CONTENT

  In order to function properly, the database must have some initial content.  There is no
  definition today of what that minimum content is as some of it depends on the configuration settings.
  
  After you create the database and app servers, you can use use the script in the tools directory
  to copy the contents of the dmc-stage.marklogic.com staging server into your development database.
  You may need to adjust ports, database names and hostnames.


CODE NOTES

The three most important code directories are "model", "view",
and "controller":

  model
    Contains XQuery modules for data access and document filtering.

  view
    Contains the XSLT code for rendering the content of the site,
    including navigational behavior, widget rendering, implementation
    of the tag library, etc. The stylesheet "page.xsl" is the only
    top-level stylesheet that gets invoked. It imports or includes
    everything else.

  controller
    Contains the URL rewriter and XQuery scripts for handling HTTP
    requests and for invoking the (XSLT) view code (transform.xqy).


Another important directory is "config":

  config
    Contains the sitemap configuration, XHTML template configuration,
    server URL configuration, and widget configuration.


On the content management side:

  admin
    Contains a complete application for managing XML content via
    Web forms. Contains its own "model", "view", "controller", and
    "config" directories.


For more details, see the various README.txt files appearing in
sub-directories.
